# Augmented Reality Audio Visualizer

An iOS app created with the goal of learning more about ARKit and Swift. When you touch the screen, a 3D grid is placed on the surface, serving as an interactive representation of the audio playing in the environment. The project uses Apple SceneKit for the 3D graphics and Superpowered SDK for audio processing.

## TODO

- [ ] Add audio source selection: toggle between song and microphone.
- [ ] Add extra visualizers, inspired by classic audio visualizers (e.g., Winamp).
- [ ] Ensure bars in grid grow only in the positive direction from the initial y-point.
